# 2048 Game

Welcome to the **2048 Game**, a simple and engaging tile-merging puzzle game!

## How to Play

1. Use the **arrow keys** (up, down, left, right) to slide all the tiles on the board in the chosen direction.
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, doubling their value (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).
3. The goal is to reach the **2048 tile**, but you can continue playing to achieve an even higher score.

## Scoring System

- **Score is calculated based on the sum of the values of tiles merged during the game.**
  - For example:
    - If two 2s merge to form 4, your score increases by 4.
    - If two 16s merge to form 32, your score increases by 32.
- The score accumulates as you continue merging tiles. Strive for the highest score possible!

## Features

- Minimalist design for a distraction-free gaming experience.
- "Game Over" overlay displayed when no moves are possible.
- Real-time score tracking as you merge tiles.
