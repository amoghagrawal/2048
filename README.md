# 2048 Game

Welcome to the **2048 Game**, a simple and engaging tile-merging puzzle game. You can chose to play solo or play against a bot under an intense 1v1 battle.

## How to Play

1. Use the **arrow keys** (up, down, left, right) to slide all the tiles on the board in the chosen direction
2. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, doubling their value (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4)
3. The goal is to reach the **2048 tile**, but you can continue playing to achieve an even higher score

## Scoring System

- **Score is calculated based on the sum of the values of tiles merged during the game.**
  - For example:
    - If two 2s merge to form 4, your score increases by 4
    - If two 16s merge to form 32, your score increases by 32
- The score accumulates as you continue merging tiles. Strive for the highest score possible
